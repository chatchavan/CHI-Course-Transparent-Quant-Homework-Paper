You may need to import several packages. See the codes provided in lecture 1-3.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Data

The data comes from three experimental conditions (within-subjects design):

* `PBg` Finger motion on screen shifts the background
* `PCam` Finger motion on screen shifts the camera
* `TECam` Press edge of the screen that the background is to shift towards

Three measurements are collected and aggregated from three panning of the user interface:

* `avg_time_sec_*` average time
* `avg_moves_*` average number of moves
* `total_errors_*` total number of errors (wrong direction)

For your convenience, the data comes in both wide and long format.

```{r load data}
data_wide <- 
  read_csv("data/Johnson1995-wide.csv", col_types = "cicddddddiii")


data_long <-
  read_csv("data/Johnson1995-long.csv", col_types = "cicccd")
```
